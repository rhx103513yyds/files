FurMark is a stress test utility for graphics cards (GPUs). It's also an OpenGL
and Vulkan graphics benchmark. FurMark is available for Windows and Linux. 
It is based on the proto-engine GeeXLab (https://geeks3d.com/geexlab/).

At the end of a benchmark preset (P1080, P1440 or P2160), the score can be
submitted to an online database. The scores page is available here:
